# Chef Intermediate

This is the repository dedicated to developing the **Chef Intermediate**.

## Abstract / Description

Chef Intermediate is an instructor-led course that introduces you to test-driven development and extending your cookbooks.

Building cookbooks with tests will increase the speed at which you work by giving you consistent feedback throughout the entire cookbook development process. Extending your cookbooks with custom resources will increase clarity within your recipes and provide resources that are portable to other cookbooks. While Ohai plugins gather data from your nodes that will aid in more dynamic recipes and extensive reporting.

In this course you will learn how to confidently refactor and extend a cookbook through explanation, demonstration, practice, and discussion. At the end of the course, you will have created a code repository that can be applied to solve the unique challenges you face managing your infrastructure.

## Learner Requirements

## Workstation Setup

These modules focus on getting learners engaged with the content as quickly as possible. A workstation is provided to the learners. Details about what the workstation looks like can be found in [WORKSTATION.md](WORKSTATION.md).

For us at Chef this workstation is currently being managed as a Amazon Machine Instance (AMI). This AMI is managed by Chef through the Training AWS Account.

* Intermediate - CentOS 6.7 - 3.0.2

The AMI was generated with [Packer](https://github.com/chef-training/chefdk-image) and adheres to the following [policy](https://github.com/chef-training/chefdk-image/blob/master/cookbooks/workstations/recipes/intermediate.rb). It is based on a Marketplace AMI so it cannot be made public. If you would like access to this AMI to deliver training please contact [training@chef.io](mailto:training@chef.io) the request that includes your Amazon Account Id.
